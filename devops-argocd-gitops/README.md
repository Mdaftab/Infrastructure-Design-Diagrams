# Argo CD GitOps Deployment Approach

This architecture diagram illustrates a standard GitOps workflow using Argo CD for deploying applications to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Use Case

Organizations using Kubernetes that want to implement declarative, Git-based continuous deployment, enabling faster, more reliable, and auditable application releases.

## Architecture Overview

The core principle of this GitOps approach is using Git as the single source of truth for the desired state of the application and infrastructure. Developers commit changes to application code and Kubernetes manifests (defining the desired state). A CI pipeline builds and tests the application, pushing container images to a registry. Argo CD, the GitOps controller, continuously monitors the Git repository for changes in the desired state and the Kubernetes cluster's actual state. When a difference is detected, Argo CD automatically (or manually, depending on configuration) synchronizes the cluster's actual state to match the desired state defined in Git.

## Key Components

### Development Workflow
- **Developer**: Writes and commits changes to application code and Kubernetes manifests.
- **Code Commit (Application Code)**: Committing changes to the application's source code.
- **Infra Commit (Kubernetes Manifests)**: Committing changes to the declarative configuration files (YAML) that define the desired state of the application in Kubernetes (Deployments, Services, Ingress, etc.).

### Git Repositories
- **Application Code Repo**: Stores the source code of the application.
- **Kubernetes Manifests Repo (Desired State)**: Stores the declarative Kubernetes configuration files. This repository represents the single source of truth for the desired state of the cluster.

### CI Pipeline
- **CI Pipeline**: Automates the process of building, testing, and packaging the application code into container images.
- **Container Registry**: Stores the built container images (e.g., Docker Hub, GCR, ACR, ECR).

### GitOps Controller
- **Argo CD (GitOps Controller)**: A declarative continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It automates the deployment of the desired application states defined in the Git repository to the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Argo CD API/UI**: Provides an interface for developers and operators to visualize the deployment status, synchronize applications, and manage Argo CD configurations.

### Kubernetes Cluster
- **Kubernetes API Server**: The control plane component that exposes the Kubernetes API. Argo CD interacts with the API server to compare the desired state (from Git) with the actual state (in the cluster) and apply changes.
- **Kubernetes Nodes**: The worker machines that run the containerized applications.
- **Running Applications (Actual State)**: The current state of the applications deployed on the Kubernetes cluster.

### Observability & Monitoring
- **Monitoring**: Collecting metrics, logs, and traces from the running applications and the Kubernetes cluster to gain visibility into their health and performance.
- **Alerting**: Notifying teams when specific conditions or anomalies are detected by the monitoring system.

## Key Design Decisions

### Git as Single Source of Truth
- All desired state is defined in Git, providing a clear, versioned, and auditable record of deployments.

### Declarative Deployments
- Kubernetes manifests declaratively define the desired state, and Argo CD ensures the cluster matches this state.

### Automated Synchronization
- Argo CD automatically detects and reconciles differences between the desired state in Git and the actual state in the cluster.

### Pull-Based Deployment
- Argo CD pulls changes from Git, rather than the CI pipeline pushing changes to the cluster, enhancing security and reliability.

### Visibility
- The Argo CD UI provides clear visibility into the deployment status and synchronization state of applications.

## Real-World Applications

- Deploying microservices to Kubernetes
- Managing infrastructure as code using Kubernetes-native tools (e.g., Crossplane)
- Implementing continuous delivery for cloud-native applications
- Ensuring consistency across multiple Kubernetes environments
- Enabling faster and more frequent application releases
