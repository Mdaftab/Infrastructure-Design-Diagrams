# Datadog Log Management Flow

This architecture diagram illustrates the typical flow of logs from applications and infrastructure into the Datadog platform, through ingestion and processing, and finally to analysis and visualization in the Datadog UI.

## Use Case

Organizations using Datadog for monitoring and observability who want to centralize, process, analyze, and visualize logs from various sources to gain insights into application behavior, troubleshoot issues, and set up alerts.

## Architecture Overview

Logs are generated by applications and the underlying infrastructure. Datadog Agents, deployed on hosts or within containers, collect these logs. Alternatively, logs from cloud services can be collected via specific integrations (e.g., pulling logs from S3 buckets, CloudWatch Logs, or Azure Blob Storage). The collected logs are sent to the Datadog platform's Log Ingestion layer. From there, they pass through Log Processing Pipelines, where they are parsed, enriched with context (like tags or metadata), and potentially filtered. The processed logs are then indexed for storage and fast searching. The Log Analytics Engine enables further analysis, including pattern detection and generating metrics from logs. Finally, users interact with the logs through the Datadog UI, using the Log Explorer for searching, Dashboards for visualization, and Monitors for setting up alerts.

## Key Components

### Applications & Infrastructure
- **Application A/B (Generates Logs)**: Applications that produce log output detailing their operations, errors, and events.
- **Infrastructure (Hosts, Containers, Services)**: The environment where applications run, also generating system-level logs.

### Datadog Agents & Integrations
- **Datadog Agent (Host/Container)**: Software installed on hosts or as a sidecar/daemonset in containerized environments to collect logs (and other telemetry like metrics and traces) and forward them to the Datadog platform.
- **Cloud/Service Integrations**: Mechanisms to collect logs directly from cloud provider services (e.g., serverless function logs, managed database logs, object storage logs).

### Datadog Platform
- **Log Ingestion**: The entry point for all log data sent to Datadog. Handles receiving and buffering high volumes of logs.
- **Log Processing Pipelines**: Configurable pipelines that transform raw log data. Steps include parsing logs into structured formats, enriching logs with relevant context (e.g., hostnames, service names, user IDs), and filtering out irrelevant logs.
- **Log Indexing**: The system that stores the processed logs in an optimized format for fast searching and querying.
- **Log Analytics Engine**: Provides capabilities for analyzing log data, such as identifying common log patterns, detecting anomalies, and aggregating log data into metrics.

### Datadog UI & Features
- **Log Explorer**: The primary interface for users to search, filter, and analyze logs interactively.
- **Dashboards**: Visual representations of log data, often combined with metrics and traces, to provide a unified view of system health and performance.
- **Monitors**: Alerting rules based on log queries or log-based metrics, notifying users when specific conditions are met (e.g., a sudden increase in error logs).
- **Log Patterns**: Feature that automatically identifies common patterns in log data, helping to spot anomalies and frequent events.
- **Log-Based Metrics**: Ability to extract numerical metrics from log data (e.g., count of errors per minute) for time-series analysis and alerting.

## Key Design Decisions

### Centralized Log Collection
- Consolidating logs from all sources into a single platform simplifies monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Structured Logging
- Parsing and processing logs into a structured format (JSON, key-value pairs) makes them easier to search, filter, and analyze.

### Contextual Enrichment
- Adding metadata and tags to logs provides valuable context for filtering and correlation with other telemetry data.

### Real-time Processing
- Logs are processed and indexed in near real-time, allowing for quick access and analysis.

### Integrated Observability
- Datadog combines logs with metrics and traces, enabling users to correlate different types of telemetry for a holistic view.

## Real-World Applications

- Troubleshooting application errors by searching logs
- Monitoring system health and performance through log-based metrics
- Detecting security incidents by analyzing access logs
- Understanding user behavior by analyzing application logs
- Setting up alerts for critical events logged by applications or infrastructure
