# Media Streaming Platform

This architecture illustrates a multi-cloud media streaming platform designed to efficiently ingest, process, and deliver both live and on-demand video content to a global audience.

## Use Case

A media company needs to ingest, process, store, and deliver high-quality video content to millions of viewers across different devices with minimal latency.

## Architecture Overview

The system leverages a multi-cloud approach to take advantage of best-in-class services from different providers, with GCP handling content processing, AWS managing content delivery, and Azure providing user management capabilities.

## Key Components

### Content Sources
- **Live Streams**: Real-time broadcasting from studios or events
- **VOD Content**: Pre-recorded, professionally produced content
- **Creator Uploads**: User-generated content from platform creators

### GCP - Content Processing
- **Cloud Storage**: Temporary storage for raw media content
- **Media Processing API**: Content validation, analysis, and metadata extraction
- **Transcoding Service**: Conversion to various formats and quality levels
- **Content API**: Centralized API for content management services

### AWS - Content Delivery
- **S3**: Long-term storage for processed media assets
- **MediaConvert**: File-based video transcoding for VOD content
- **MediaLive**: Real-time video transcoding for live streams
- **CloudFront**: Global content delivery network with edge caching

### Azure - User Management
- **AKS Cluster**: Managed Kubernetes for user-facing services
- **Cosmos DB**: Globally distributed database for user profiles and preferences
- **Azure Cache for Redis**: Session management and content recommendations
- **Application Gateway**: Secure entry point for user traffic

### Data & Analytics Platform
- **Pub/Sub**: Event-driven messaging for real-time analytics
- **Dataflow**: Stream and batch processing of viewing data
- **BigQuery**: Data warehouse for audience analytics
- **Looker**: Business intelligence and dashboarding

### CI/CD & Infrastructure
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow automation for CI/CD
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps-based deployment to Kubernetes
- **Terraform**: Multi-cloud infrastructure as code
- **Atlantis**: Terraform automation and collaboration

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Datadog**: Unified monitoring across cloud providers
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection for containerized services
- **Grafana**: Visualization dashboards
- **PagerDuty**: Incident response management

## Key Design Decisions

### Multi-Cloud Strategy
- Leverages best-in-class services from each cloud provider
- Avoids vendor lock-in while optimizing for specific workloads
- Distributes workloads based on provider strengths
- Unified observability layer across all providers

### Content Processing
- Parallel transcoding for multiple quality levels
- Content-aware encoding to optimize quality-to-bitrate ratio
- Automated quality control and compliance checking
- Metadata enrichment for improved discoverability

### Global Content Delivery
- Multi-regional origin access for reduced latency
- Dynamic packaging for device-specific optimization
- Adaptive bitrate streaming for varying network conditions
- Edge caching for popular content

### Scalability
- Auto-scaling for transcoding resources based on ingest volume
- Elastic delivery capacity for traffic spikes
- Regional routing for optimal viewer experience
- Separation of live and VOD processing paths

### Reliability
- Redundant ingest points for live streaming
- Multi-region storage for processed content
- Health monitoring for the entire delivery pipeline
- Automated failover mechanisms

## Real-World Applications

This architecture is well-suited for:

- OTT streaming services with both live and on-demand content
- Multi-channel networks with diverse creator content
- Sports broadcasting platforms with global viewership
- Educational platforms with video-based learning materials

The design balances high-quality video processing with cost-effective delivery at scale, while providing the necessary analytics for content optimization and business intelligence.
