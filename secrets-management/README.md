# Secrets Management Architecture

This architecture diagram illustrates a secure approach to managing secrets (like API keys, database credentials, certificates) throughout the application lifecycle, from development to production runtime.

## Use Case

Organizations needing to securely store, distribute, and rotate sensitive information required by applications and services, avoiding hardcoding secrets in code or configuration files.

## Architecture Overview

The core of the architecture is a centralized Secrets Management System. Developers and CI/CD pipelines interact with this system to retrieve secrets during build or deployment processes, but secrets are not stored directly in the code repository or plain-text configuration files. Applications running in the runtime environment retrieve secrets from the Secrets Management System at runtime, typically through secure APIs or agents. The Secrets Management System integrates with key management services for encryption and provides audit logs for compliance and monitoring.

## Key Components

### Development & CI/CD
- **Developer**: Writes application code and configuration, but does not handle secrets directly.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated workflows for building, testing, and deploying applications. Interacts with the Secrets Management System to inject secrets securely during deployment.
- **Code Repository**: Stores application code and configuration files, which should *not* contain sensitive secrets.
- **Configuration Files (No Secrets)**: Application configuration files that reference secrets by name or path, but do not contain the secret values themselves.

### Secrets Management System
- **Secrets Manager**: A dedicated system or service for securely storing, managing, and distributing secrets. Provides features like access control, versioning, and rotation. Examples include HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud Secret Manager.
- **Audit Logs**: Records all access and modifications to secrets for compliance and security monitoring.
- **Encryption Keys (KMS)**: The Secrets Management System typically uses encryption keys managed by a Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt secrets at rest.

### Runtime Environment
- **Applications / Services**: The software components that require access to secrets to function (e.g., connect to a database, call an external API).
- **Compute Resources**: The infrastructure where applications run (VMs, containers, serverless functions). These resources need appropriate permissions to access the Secrets Management System.
- **Database / External Service**: The resources or services that the applications need to authenticate with using secrets.

## Key Design Decisions

### Centralization
- Storing all secrets in a single, secure system simplifies management and improves control.

### Least Privilege Access
- Granting applications and users only the necessary permissions to access specific secrets.

### Automation
- Automating secret injection during CI/CD and retrieval at runtime reduces manual handling and the risk of exposure.

### Encryption
- Encrypting secrets at rest using a KMS provides an additional layer of security.

### Auditing
- Comprehensive audit logs are essential for tracking who accessed which secrets and when.

### Rotation
- Regularly rotating secrets (e.g., database passwords) reduces the window of opportunity for compromised credentials to be exploited.

## Real-World Applications

- Managing database credentials for applications
- Storing API keys for external service integrations
- Distributing TLS/SSL certificates
- Managing SSH keys for infrastructure access
- Storing configuration values that contain sensitive information
