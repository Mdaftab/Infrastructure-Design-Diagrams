# Serverless API with Database

This architecture demonstrates a common pattern for building scalable and cost-effective APIs using serverless compute and managed database services.

## Use Case

Building APIs for web or mobile applications, microservices, or integrating different systems, where automatic scaling and pay-per-execution pricing are desirable.

## Architecture Overview

The serverless API architecture leverages managed services to minimize operational overhead. The API Gateway handles incoming requests, routing them to serverless functions that execute the business logic and interact with a managed database.

## Key Components

### Client Layer
- **End User**: Interacts with the API through a web browser, mobile application, or other client.

### API Layer
- **API Gateway**: Acts as the front door for the API, handling tasks such as request routing, authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and caching. Examples include AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management, or Google Cloud API Gateway.

### Compute Layer
- **Serverless Functions**: Execute the API's business logic in response to incoming requests. These functions automatically scale based on demand, and you only pay for the compute time consumed. Examples include AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions.

### Data Layer
- **Database**: Stores the data accessed and manipulated by the API. This can be a NoSQL database for high-throughput, low-latency access (e.g., AWS DynamoDB, Azure Cosmos DB) or a relational database if needed (e.g
