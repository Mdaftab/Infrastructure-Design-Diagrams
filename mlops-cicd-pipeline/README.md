# CI/CD Pipeline for ML Models

This architecture extends traditional CI/CD practices to the machine learning lifecycle, enabling automated and continuous integration, testing, and deployment of ML models.

## Use Case

Organizations building and deploying ML models that require frequent updates, automated testing, version control, and reliable deployment processes.

## Architecture Overview

The CI/CD pipeline for ML models integrates code changes, data updates, and model development into an automated workflow. The CI phase focuses on building and testing the code and potentially retraining/evaluating the model. The CD phase handles the automated deployment of validated models to different environments and includes post-deployment monitoring.

## Key Components

### Development
- **Code Repository**: Stores the source code for the ML project, including training scripts, model code, and deployment configurations (e.g., Git).
- **Data Storage**: Stores the datasets used for training and evaluation (e.g., S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage).

### CI Pipeline
- **CI Trigger**: Initiates the CI pipeline based on events like code pushes or pull requests.
- **Code Tests**: Standard software development tests (unit, integration) for the ML code.
- **Static Analysis**: Automated checks for code quality, style, and security vulnerabilities.
- **Build Artifacts**: Packaging the code and dependencies into deployable artifacts (e.g., container images).
- **Model Training (CI)**: Automatically retraining the model with the latest code and data.
- **Model Evaluation (CI)**: Evaluating the performance of the newly trained model using automated metrics.
- **Model Versioning**: Registering and versioning the trained model and its metadata in a model registry.

### CD Pipeline
- **CD Trigger**: Initiates the CD pipeline upon successful completion of the CI pipeline or based on manual approval.
- **Integration Tests**: Testing the integration of the model artifact with other system components.
- **Model Tests**: Specific tests for the model itself, such as performance tests, fairness tests, or robustness tests.
- **Deploy to Staging**: Automatically deploying the validated model to a staging environment for further testing.
- **Staging Tests**: End-to-end tests in the staging environment to simulate production usage.
- **Deploy to Production**: Automatically deploying the model to the production environment.
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring the model's performance, data drift, and concept drift in production.
- **Alerting**: Notifying relevant teams when monitoring detects issues with the deployed model.

## Key Design Decisions

### Automation
- Automating the entire pipeline reduces manual effort, speeds up the release cycle, and minimizes human error.

### Versioning
- Versioning code, data, and models ensures reproducibility and traceability.

### Testing
- Implementing comprehensive testing at various stages (code, model, integration, staging) ensures the quality and reliability of the deployed model.

### Continuous Monitoring
- Monitoring deployed models is crucial for detecting performance degradation and data/concept drift, triggering retraining or rollback as needed.

### Collaboration
- A well-defined CI/CD pipeline facilitates collaboration between data scientists, ML engineers, and operations teams.

## Real-World Applications

- Deploying updated recommendation models
- Releasing new versions of fraud detection systems
- Continuously improving image recognition models
- Automating the update of predictive maintenance models
