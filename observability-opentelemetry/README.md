# OpenTelemetry Observability Architecture

This architecture diagram illustrates a standardized approach to collecting, processing, and exporting telemetry data (metrics, traces, and logs) from applications and infrastructure using OpenTelemetry.

## Use Case

Organizations needing a vendor-neutral way to instrument their applications and collect observability data, allowing flexibility in choosing backend analysis and visualization tools.

## Architecture Overview

The OpenTelemetry architecture consists of SDKs embedded within applications for instrumentation and a Collector that receives, processes, and exports telemetry data. Applications and infrastructure components generate telemetry data using OpenTelemetry SDKs or agents. This data is sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector, which can run as an agent on hosts or as a gateway. The Collector processes the data (e.g., filtering, sampling, transforming) and exports it to various backend systems for storage, analysis, and visualization (e.g., Prometheus for metrics, Jaeger/Tempo for traces, Loki/OpenSearch for logs). Dashboarding and alerting systems consume data from these backends.

## Key Components

### Applications & Services
- **Application A/B (Instrumented)**: Applications that have been instrumented using OpenTelemetry SDKs to generate metrics, traces, and logs.
- **Infrastructure (Hosts, Containers)**: The underlying compute resources where applications run. Can also be instrumented or have agents deployed to collect infrastructure-level telemetry.

### OpenTelemetry Components
- **OTel SDKs (in Applications)**: Software Development Kits embedded within application code to generate and export telemetry data. Available for various programming languages.
- **OTel Collector (Agent/Gateway)**: A vendor-agnostic proxy that receives, processes, and exports telemetry data. Can be deployed as an agent alongside applications or as a central gateway.

### Backend Systems
- **Metrics Backend**: Stores and queries time-series metrics (e.g., Prometheus, cloud provider monitoring services like Cloud Monitoring).
- **Traces Backend**: Stores and visualizes distributed traces to understand request flows across services (e.g., Jaeger, Tempo, cloud provider tracing services like Cloud Trace).
- **Logs Backend**: Stores and enables searching and analysis of log data (e.g., Loki, OpenSearch, cloud provider logging services like Cloud Logging).
- **Analytics Backend**: Data warehouses or data lakes where telemetry data can be stored for long-term retention and complex analytical queries (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake).

### Analysis & Visualization
- **Dashboarding**: Tools used to create visual representations of metrics, traces, and logs for monitoring and analysis (e.g., Grafana, Looker Studio).
- **Alerting System**: Triggers notifications based on predefined thresholds or anomalies detected in the telemetry data.
- **Analytics Tools**: Tools used to perform deeper analysis on the data stored in analytics backends.

## Key Design Decisions

### Vendor Neutrality
- OpenTelemetry provides a standardized way to instrument and collect data, avoiding vendor lock-in for observability backends.

### Data Collection Flexibility
- The Collector can be deployed in various modes (agent, gateway) and configured to receive data in multiple formats.

### Data Processing Capabilities
- The Collector can process data before exporting, reducing the load on backend systems and enabling features like sampling.

### Backend Flexibility
- Telemetry data can be exported to different backend systems optimized for metrics, traces, and logs.

### Unified Observability
- While data might be stored in different backends, dashboarding and alerting can provide a unified view across all telemetry types.

## Real-World Applications

- Monitoring microservices performance and dependencies
- Troubleshooting distributed systems
- Analyzing application logs for errors and trends
- Tracking infrastructure health and resource utilization
- Building comprehensive observability platforms
