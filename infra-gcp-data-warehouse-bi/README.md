# Data Warehouse and BI on GCP

This architecture demonstrates a common pattern for building a data warehouse and business intelligence solution on Google Cloud Platform, leveraging its managed data services.

## Use Case

Organizations needing to consolidate data from various sources for reporting, dashboards, and analytical querying to gain business insights.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture utilizes Cloud Storage as a landing zone for raw data. Data is then ingested and transformed using Dataflow or Data Fusion before being loaded into BigQuery, Google's fully managed, serverless data warehouse. Dataproc can be used for additional processing needs. Finally, Looker Studio and Looker are used for creating dashboards and performing business intelligence analysis on the data in BigQuery. Vertex AI can access the data for machine learning purposes.

## Key Components

### Data Sources
- **Source A/B**: Various origins of data, such as operational databases, applications, or third-party data feeds.

### Ingestion
- **Cloud Storage (Landing Zone)**: A scalable and cost-effective object storage service used as a temporary landing zone for raw data before processing.
- **Dataflow (Streaming/Batch ETL)**: A fully managed service for executing Apache Beam pipelines, suitable for both streaming and batch data processing and transformation.
- **Data Fusion (ETL/ELT)**: A fully managed, cloud-native data integration service that helps users efficiently build and manage ETL/ELT data pipelines.

### Storage & Processing
- **BigQuery (Data Warehouse)**: A fully managed, serverless data warehouse that enables super-fast SQL queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure. It's optimized for large datasets and analytical workloads.
- **Dataproc (Spark/Hadoop)**: A fully managed, highly scalable service for running Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, and other open-source data processing frameworks. Useful for complex data transformations or processing data directly in Cloud Storage.

### Business Intelligence & Analytics
- **Looker Studio (Dashboards)**: A free tool that turns your data into informative dashboards and reports that are easy to read, share, and customize.
- **Looker (BI Platform)**: A more comprehensive enterprise business intelligence, data applications, and embedded analytics platform.
- **Vertex AI (ML)**: Google Cloud's unified platform for building, deploying, and scaling machine learning models. It can access data stored in BigQuery for training and prediction.

## Key Design Decisions

### Serverless Data Warehouse
- BigQuery's serverless nature simplifies management and allows scaling based on query load.

### Flexible Ingestion
- Offering both Dataflow and Data Fusion provides options for different ETL/ELT needs and user skill sets.

### Scalable Storage
- Using Cloud Storage as a landing zone is cost-effective and scales automatically.

### Integrated BI Tools
- Leveraging Looker Studio and Looker provides powerful visualization and analysis capabilities directly integrated with BigQuery.

### ML Integration
- Seamless integration with Vertex AI allows for building and deploying machine learning models on the data warehouse.

## Real-World Applications
