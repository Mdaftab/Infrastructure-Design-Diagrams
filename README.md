# Mermaid Infrastructure Diagrams

This repository contains a collection of state-of-the-art infrastructure design diagrams created with Mermaid.js, showcasing cutting-edge best practices for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud Architecture implementations.

## Repository Structure

Each subdirectory represents a different infrastructure example, with its own Mermaid diagram and detailed explanation:

- **infra-microservices-mesh-platform**: Cloud-native microservices architecture with service mesh, progressive delivery, GitOps, and FinOps practices
- **infra-ecommerce-realtime-system**: E-commerce platform with real-time inventory tracking, AI-powered analytics, and comprehensive SRE practices
- **infra-healthcare-data-platform**: HIPAA-compliant healthcare data processing system with FHIR integration and edge computing for medical IoT
- **infra-fintech-payment-system**: High-security financial transaction processing platform with fraud detection, compliance controls, and transaction integrity guarantees
- **infra-media-streaming-platform**: Multi-cloud media content delivery system with AI-powered content analysis and multi-DRM protection
- **infra-iot-manufacturing-system**: Smart manufacturing with edge-cloud architecture, digital twin capabilities, and OT/IT security integration
- **Infra_with_tf_GCP_crossplane**: Multi-cloud architecture with Terraform and Crossplane for infrastructure unification

## Purpose

These diagrams are designed to:

1. Demonstrate real-world infrastructure patterns that follow industry best practices
2. Provide educational examples for DevOps engineers, SREs, and cloud architects
3. Showcase complex system designs in a clear, visual format
4. Illustrate various approaches to reliability, scalability, and security in modern cloud architectures
5. Demonstrate integration of cutting-edge technologies for specific industry use cases

## Usage

Each example contains:

1. A `diagram.md` file with the Mermaid.js diagram code
2. A `README.md` that explains:
   - The use case being addressed
   - Key architectural components
   - Design decisions and their rationales
   - Real-world applications and considerations

To view the diagrams:
- GitHub automatically renders Mermaid diagrams in markdown files
- For local viewing, use a Mermaid-compatible editor or the Mermaid Live Editor at https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/
- Consider using VS Code with the Mermaid extension for editing and previewing

## Contributing
