# Mermaid Infrastructure Diagrams

This repository contains a collection of infrastructure design diagrams created with Mermaid.js, showcasing best practices for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud Architecture implementations.

## Repository Structure

Each subdirectory represents a different infrastructure example, with its own Mermaid diagram and detailed explanation:

- **infra-microservices-mesh-platform**: Cloud-native microservices architecture with service mesh and GitOps
- **infra-ecommerce-realtime-system**: E-commerce platform with real-time inventory tracking and analytics
- **infra-healthcare-data-platform**: HIPAA-compliant healthcare data processing system
- **infra-fintech-payment-system**: High-security financial transaction processing platform
- **infra-media-streaming-platform**: Multi-cloud media content delivery system
- **infra-iot-manufacturing-system**: Smart manufacturing with edge-cloud architecture
- **Infra_with_tf_GCP_crossplane**: Multi-cloud architecture with Terraform and Crossplane

## Purpose

These diagrams are designed to:

1. Demonstrate real-world infrastructure patterns that follow industry best practices
2. Provide educational examples for DevOps engineers, SREs, and cloud architects
3. Showcase complex system designs in a clear, visual format
4. Illustrate various approaches to reliability, scalability, and security in modern cloud architectures

## Features Demonstrated

The examples collectively showcase:

- Multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud architectures
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, Crossplane, and other tools
- CI/CD pipelines and GitOps workflows
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Service mesh implementations
- Event-driven architectures
- Real-time data processing
- Edge computing patterns
- Security and compliance controls
- Disaster recovery approaches
- Observability and monitoring solutions

## Usage

Each example contains:

1. A `diagram.md` file with the Mermaid.js diagram code
2. A `README.md` that explains:
   - The use case being addressed
   - Key architectural components
   - Design decisions and their rationales
   - Real-world applications

To view the diagrams:
- GitHub automatically renders Mermaid diagrams in markdown files
- For local viewing, use a Mermaid-compatible editor or the Mermaid Live Editor at https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/

## Contributing

Contributions of new infrastructure patterns or improvements to existing ones are welcome. Please follow these guidelines:
- Focus on realistic, production-grade architectures
- Include comprehensive documentation explaining the design
- Ensure diagrams are clear and follow Mermaid.js best practices
- Maintain consistent formatting across examples
