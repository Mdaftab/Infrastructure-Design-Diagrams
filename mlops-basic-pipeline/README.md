# Basic ML Training and Deployment Pipeline

This diagram illustrates a fundamental pipeline for taking raw data, training a machine learning model, and preparing it for deployment.

## Use Case

A simple workflow for developing and deploying a machine learning model, suitable for initial MLOps adoption or less complex projects.

## Architecture Overview

The pipeline follows a sequential flow, starting with data preparation, moving through model development steps, and ending with packaging the model for deployment.

## Key Components

### Data Preparation
- **Data Ingestion**: The process of collecting raw data from various sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for model training (e.g., handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables).

### Model Development
- **Model Training**: The process of feeding the preprocessed data into an ML algorithm to train a model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.

### Model Deployment
- **Model Packaging**: Serializing the trained model and its dependencies into a deployable format (e.g., Docker container, ONNX format).
- **Model Deployment**: Making the packaged model available for inference, either in a production environment (e.g., on a server, in the cloud) or for batch predictions.

## Key Design Decisions

### Simplicity
- This pipeline focuses on the core steps, providing a clear and easy-to-understand workflow.

### Sequential Flow
- The steps are executed in a defined order, which is straightforward for basic use cases.

### Foundation for MLOps
- While basic, this pipeline serves as a foundation that can be extended with more advanced MLOps practices like automation, versioning, and monitoring.

## Real-World Applications

- Simple classification or regression tasks
- Proof-of-concept ML projects
- Educational examples for MLOps beginners
- Batch prediction workflows
