# Event-Driven Data Lake Architecture

This architecture outlines a scalable and flexible approach to ingesting, storing, processing, and analyzing large volumes of structured and unstructured data using an event-driven paradigm.

## Use Case

Organizations needing to consolidate data from various sources for analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence, particularly when dealing with real-time or near real-time data streams alongside batch data.

## Architecture Overview

The event-driven data lake architecture centers around a centralized data repository (the data lake) that stores data in its raw format. Data is ingested from various sources, often through streaming or batch processes. Processing layers transform and refine the data, which is then stored in a curated format within the data lake or moved to a data warehouse for easier consumption by analytics and ML services.

## Key Components

### Data Sources
- **Source A/B**: Various origins of data, including applications, IoT devices, databases, APIs, logs, etc.

### Ingestion Layer
- **Streaming Service**: Handles high-velocity, real-time data streams. Examples include AWS Kinesis, Azure Event Hubs, or Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
- **Batch Ingestion**: Used for transferring data in batches from sources like databases or file systems. Examples include AWS DataSync, Azure Data Factory, or Google Cloud Data Transfer.

### Storage Layer
- **Raw Data Lake**: A cost-effective storage layer for storing data in its original format. This provides flexibility for future processing needs. Examples include AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, or Google Cloud Storage.
- **Processed Data Lake**: Stores data that has been cleaned, transformed, and enriched, making it ready for analysis.

### Processing Layer
- **Stream Processing**: Processes real-time data streams as they arrive. Examples include AWS Kinesis Data Analytics, Azure Stream Analytics, or Google Cloud Dataflow.
- **Batch Processing**: Processes large volumes of data in batches. Examples include AWS EMR, Databricks, or Google Cloud Dataproc.
- **ETL/ELT Tools**: Tools used for Extract, Transform, Load or Extract, Load, Transform processes to move and prepare data. Examples include AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory, or Google Cloud Data Fusion.

### Consumption Layer
- **Data Warehouse**: A structured repository optimized for analytical queries and reporting. Examples include AWS Redshift, Azure Synapse Analytics, or Google Cloud BigQuery.
- **Analytics Tools**: Business intelligence and visualization tools used to explore and report on the data. Examples include AWS QuickSight, Power BI, or Looker.
- **ML Services**: Platforms and services used for building, training, and deploying machine learning models using the data in the lake. Examples include AWS SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning, or Google Cloud Vertex AI.

## Key Design Decisions

### Centralized Storage
- Storing data in a data lake provides a single source of truth and allows for schema-on-read flexibility.

### Event-Driven Ingestion
- Using streaming services enables real-time data capture and processing for time-sensitive use cases.

### Layered Architecture
- Separating raw and processed data layers ensures data integrity and provides curated datasets for consumption.

### Decoupled Processing
- Using separate processing engines for streaming and batch data allows for optimized resource utilization and flexibility.

### Accessibility
- Providing various consumption tools (data warehouse, analytics tools, ML services) caters to different user needs and use cases.
