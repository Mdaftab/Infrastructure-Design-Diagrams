# Containerized Application on Azure

This architecture illustrates a common pattern for deploying and managing containerized applications on Microsoft Azure using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Use Case

Deploying microservices or containerized applications that require orchestration, scaling, and management capabilities provided by Kubernetes, with a focus on leveraging Azure's managed services.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture centers around AKS, which hosts the containerized application. Azure Front Door and Application Gateway handle global and regional traffic management and security. Managed Azure databases and caching services provide persistent storage and performance optimization. Azure Monitor and Key Vault are integrated for monitoring, logging, and secrets management.

## Key Components

### Client Layer
- **End User**: Accesses the application through a web browser or other client.

### Network & Edge
- **Azure DNS**: Provides domain name resolution for the application.
- **Azure Front Door**: A global, scalable entry point that uses the Microsoft global edge network to create fast, secure, and highly scalable web applications. It provides global load balancing, instant failover, and caching capabilities.
- **Application Gateway**: A regional load balancer and web application firewall (WAF) that provides application-level routing and security for the AKS cluster.

### Compute & Orchestration
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: A managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications.
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: A managed Docker registry service for storing and managing private Docker container images.

### Data Layer
- **Azure Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Managed relational database services offering high availability and scalability.
- **Azure Cache for Redis**: A managed in-memory data store based on the open-source Redis cache, used for caching and session management to improve application performance.
- **Azure Storage Account**: Provides various storage services, including Blob Storage for unstructured data (e.g., user uploads, logs) and File Storage for shared access.

### Monitoring & Security
- **Azure Monitor**: A comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. It includes capabilities for monitoring application performance, infrastructure, and logs.
- **Azure Key Vault**: A service for securely storing and managing secrets, encryption keys, and SSL/TLS certificates.
- **Defender for Cloud**: Provides security posture management and threat protection across your Azure resources.

## Key Design Decisions

### Kubernetes Orchestration
- Using AKS simplifies the complexities of managing a Kubernetes control plane and provides features like auto-scaling and self-healing.

### Layered Load Balancing
- Combining Front Door (global) and Application Gateway (regional) provides robust traffic management, WAF protection, and performance optimization.

### Managed Data Services
- Leveraging managed database and caching services reduces operational overhead and provides built-in high availability and backups.

### Integrated Monitoring and Security
- Integrating Azure Monitor, Key Vault, and Defender for Cloud provides centralized visibility, secrets management, and security posture management.

### Containerization
- Packaging the application as containers ensures consistency across different environments and simplifies deployment.

## Real-World Applications

- Microservices architectures
- Web applications requiring high scalability and availability
- Applications with complex deployment and management needs
- Lift-and-shift of existing containerized workloads to the cloud
