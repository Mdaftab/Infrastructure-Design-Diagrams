# Basic IoT Data Ingestion and Monitoring System

This architecture outlines a simple and scalable system for ingesting data from a large number of IoT devices and providing basic monitoring and visualization capabilities.

## Use Case

Collecting telemetry data from a fleet of devices (e.g., sensors, simple connected products) for monitoring, analysis, and alerting, without requiring complex edge processing or control loops.

## Architecture Overview

The system focuses on efficiently receiving data from many devices, processing it minimally, storing it, and making it available for monitoring and alerting. It leverages managed cloud services for scalability and reduced operational overhead.

## Key Components

### IoT Devices
- **IoT Device A/B/N**: The source of telemetry data. These are typically simple sensors or connected products sending data periodically.

### Connectivity & Ingestion
- **IoT Hub / IoT Core / Pub/Sub**: A managed cloud service designed to handle secure, bi-directional communication with a large number of IoT devices and ingest high-throughput data streams. Examples include Azure IoT Hub, AWS IoT Core, or Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

### Processing
- **Serverless Functions**: Lightweight compute functions triggered by incoming data, used for simple tasks like data format conversion, filtering, or routing. Examples include AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions.
- **Stream Processing**: Services capable of processing data streams in near real-time for simple transformations or aggregations before storage. Examples include AWS Kinesis Data Analytics or Azure Stream Analytics.

### Storage
- **Database**: A database suitable for storing time-series data or device metadata. Examples include AWS DynamoDB, Azure Cosmos DB, or AWS Timestream.
- **Data Lake**: A cost-effective storage repository for storing raw or processed IoT data for later analysis. Examples include AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, or Google Cloud Storage.

### Monitoring & Visualization
- **Monitoring Tools**: Cloud-native services for collecting metrics, logs, and traces from the system components. Examples include AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, or Google Cloud Monitoring.
- **Dashboard**: Tools for visualizing the ingested data and system metrics, providing operational insights. Examples include Grafana, AWS QuickSight, or Power BI.
- **Alerting**: Systems to trigger notifications based on predefined thresholds or anomalies in the data or system metrics. Examples include AWS SNS or Azure Action Groups.

## Key Design Decisions

### Managed Services
- Utilizing managed cloud services simplifies deployment, scaling, and maintenance.

### Scalability
- The ingestion and processing layers are designed to handle a large volume of incoming data from numerous devices.

### Simplicity
- The focus is on basic ingestion and monitoring, avoiding complex edge processing unless specifically required.

### Data Storage Flexibility
- Storing data in both a database (for quick access) and a data lake (for long-term storage and batch analysis) provides flexibility.

### Proactive Monitoring
- Implementing monitoring and alerting ensures operational visibility and allows for timely responses to issues or anomalies.

## Real-World Applications

- Remote sensor monitoring (e.g., environmental data, equipment status)
- Fleet management and tracking
- Smart home data collection
- Wearable device data ingestion
- Basic industrial IoT monitoring
