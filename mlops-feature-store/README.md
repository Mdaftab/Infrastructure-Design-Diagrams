# MLOps with Feature Store

This architecture highlights the integration of a Feature Store into the MLOps workflow to manage features consistently for both training and inference.

## Use Case

Organizations with multiple ML models or teams that need to share and reuse features, ensure consistency between training and serving data, and reduce feature engineering redundancy.

## Architecture Overview

The Feature Store acts as a central repository for curated and versioned features. Data from various sources is processed into features and stored in the Feature Store. Both the training and inference pipelines access features from the Feature Store, ensuring that the same feature definitions and values are used in both stages.

## Key Components

### Data Sources
- **Source A/B**: Various origins of raw data used to derive features.

### Feature Engineering
- **Feature Processing**: The process of transforming raw data into features. This can involve batch processing for historical features or stream processing for real-time features.

### Feature Store
- **Feature Store**: A centralized system for storing, managing, and serving features. It typically has an offline store for training data (often a data lake or data warehouse) and an online store for low-latency inference (often a key-value store).

### ML Pipelines
- **Training Pipeline**: Accesses historical features from the Feature Store (offline store) to train ML models.
- **Inference Pipeline**: Accesses the latest feature values from the Feature Store (online store) for making predictions.

### Model Registry
- **Model Registry**: Stores and versions trained ML models and their metadata.

### Serving Layer
- **Online Serving**: Deploys models for real-time inference via an API endpoint. It retrieves features from the Feature Store's online store.
- **Batch Serving**: Uses models to make predictions on batches of data, often retrieving features from the Feature Store's offline store.

## Key Design Decisions

### Consistency
- Using a Feature Store ensures that the features used for training and inference are consistent, preventing training-serving skew.

### Reusability
- Features can be easily shared and reused across different models and teams, reducing redundant feature engineering effort.

### Discoverability
- The Feature Store provides a central place to discover available features and their definitions.

### Time Travel
- Feature Stores often support "time travel" capabilities, allowing retrieval of feature values as they were at a specific point in time, which is crucial for accurate model training and debugging.

### Online/Offline Access
- Providing both online and offline access patterns caters to the different latency requirements of training and inference.

## Real-World Applications

- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Credit scoring
- Customer churn prediction
- Any ML application where feature consistency and reusability are important
