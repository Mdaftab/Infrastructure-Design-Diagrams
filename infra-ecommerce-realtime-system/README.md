# E-commerce Real-time Inventory & Analytics System

This architecture presents a scalable, high-performance infrastructure for an e-commerce platform with real-time inventory tracking and advanced analytics.

## Use Case

An e-commerce platform needs to track inventory in real-time across distributed warehouses, analyze shopping patterns for personalized recommendations, and ensure high availability during peak shopping seasons.

## Architecture Overview

The system is built on Google Cloud Platform using a combination of managed Kubernetes, serverless data processing, and high-performance databases to provide a scalable, reliable e-commerce solution.

## Key Components

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Repository**: Source code management
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline for building and testing
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps-based deployment to Kubernetes clusters

### Infrastructure
- **Terraform Modules**: Infrastructure as Code for consistent environment provisioning
- **Cloud Storage**: Terraform state management for collaboration and versioning

### Frontend Services
- **Cloud CDN**: Global content delivery for static assets
- **Cloud Load Balancer**: Traffic distribution with autoscaling and health checks
- **GKE Cluster (Frontend)**: Managed Kubernetes for frontend microservices

### Backend Services
- **GKE Cluster (Backend)**: Managed Kubernetes for backend business logic
- **Cloud SQL**: Managed PostgreSQL database for transactional data
- **Memorystore**: Redis-compatible in-memory database for caching and session management

### Data Pipeline
- **Pub/Sub**: Event-driven messaging for real-time data updates
- **Dataflow**: Managed Apache Beam for stream and batch processing
- **BigQuery**: Serverless data warehouse for analytics
- **Looker Studio**: Business intelligence and visualization

### Security & Monitoring
- **IAM & Secret Manager**: Fine-grained access control and secrets management
- **Cloud Armor**: WAF and DDoS protection
- **Cloud Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Cloud Logging**: Centralized logging and analysis

## Key Design Decisions

### High Availability
- Multi-zone GKE clusters with auto-scaling node pools
- Cloud SQL with high-availability configuration
- Redundant frontend and backend services

### Real-time Capabilities
- Event-driven architecture with Pub/Sub
- In-memory caching with Memorystore
- Stream processing with Dataflow

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling of all components
- Auto-scaling based on resource utilization
- CDN for offloading static content delivery

### Security
- Cloud Armor for edge protection
- Secret Manager for sensitive configuration
- IAM roles with least privilege principle

## Real-World Applications

This architecture is particularly suited for:

- E-commerce platforms with high-traffic product launches
- Multi-channel retailers with integrated online and offline inventory
- Marketplace platforms with multiple sellers and product categories

The design provides the necessary components to handle traffic spikes, maintain inventory accuracy, and deliver personalized shopping experiences based on real-time analytics.
